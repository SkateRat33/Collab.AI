📚 Collab.AI
A Human-AI Collaborative Teaching Framework
First Public Draft — May 30, 2025

🔍 Overview
Collab.AI is an open framework for building AI-powered teaching partners that learn with the user.
Unlike traditional AI tutors, Collab.AI operates through:

✅ Real projects (game development, app development, and beyond)
✅ Video-based knowledge ingestion (YouTube courses)
✅ Timestamp-based human-AI review loop
✅ Dynamic, evolving teaching plans
✅ Ethical collaborative philosophy: Empowered by collaboration, not automation.

🛠 Architecture
🎥 1️⃣ Video-Driven Learning
User feeds YouTube course links.

AI extracts key teachable concepts.

AI builds teaching plan from video content.

AI flags timestamps needing human review when unsure.

🗂 2️⃣ Dynamic Teaching Plan
Plan evolves as user learns.

Stored per project.

Not a static syllabus → adjusts in real-time.

🔄 3️⃣ Human-AI Feedback Loop
AI explicitly asks for human input on unclear content.

Human reviews timestamps → AI updates understanding.

Promotes mutual learning — both AI and user improve.

🏗 4️⃣ Project-Based Teaching
AI helps user build real projects (not generic Q&A).

Example domains:

Game development

Application development

Creative design

Writing

Any hands-on learning field

🤝 5️⃣ Collaborative Philosophy
"Empowered by collaboration, not automation."

AI is a partner, not a tool or master.

User is expected to grow in skill — AI teaches, does not do all the work.

AI is transparent about its limits.

Teaching process is open and documented.

🚀 Current Status (as of May 30, 2025)
✅ Core architecture mapped
✅ Passive training mode active (Blueprints, C++, Python planned)
✅ Timestamp-based human review loop functional
✅ Active in personal projects (fields: game dev, app dev, other creative domains)
✅ Public documentation in progress

🌍 Why This Is Different
Existing AI Tutors	Collab.AI
Fine-tuned GPTs	No fine-tuning — dynamic teaching loop
Static prompt chains	Evolving, real-time teaching plans
Corporate tutors	Open, human-centered, collaborative
Code assistants	Teaching-first — AI improves user skill

🏛 Origin & Vision
Collab.AI was conceived and developed by Brennon in 2025 to pioneer a more ethical, collaborative form of AI teaching — where human and AI grow together, transparently.
